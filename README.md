An Android Game Where You Guess Numbers

This is a game that I made two years ago.
The game is mainly about guessing the number that the game holds.
After each guess, the game shows you +,- or 0. + means you have found a figure in the number and it is in correct place.
\- means you have found a figure in the number but it is not at the correct place.
And 0 means, as you can guess, you have not found any figures.

After you find the number you earn no points, no bonuses, no madals no nothing :)
